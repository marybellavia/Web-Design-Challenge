# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## HTML
All the html pages have been created and link properly.
The pages were designed and coded using Bootstrap's grid layout system. 

## Pandas
I used Pandas to import the citites.csv, turn it into a dataframe, and print out the html for the table on the "Data" page.
